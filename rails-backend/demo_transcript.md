# Video Demo Transcript

I Remember When allows people to share their memories of historical events. Here on the homepage, we see a list of the most recently added memories, along with the name of the event the memory belongs to, when the event happened, and when the memory was added.

Anyone can see a list of all events by clicking Events at the top of the page. [Click Events.]

The events are listed chronologically by when they took place. [Scroll down.] To read about an event, click its name. [Click.]

Here we see the event's name, country, date, who created the event entry, a summary of the event, and a list of people's memories of the event.

We can also see a list of all the writers by clicking Writers at the top. [Click Writers.]

By clicking a writer's name, we see their bio, if they've provided one, and a button to see their memories. [Click See Memories.]

All of this we can do without creating an account. But if we want to add our own events and memories, we'll need to sign up. [Click Sign Up, fill in fields.] You can also sign up using a Google account.

Since I have an admin key, I'll add it here.

To add an event, click the Add Event button.

For a headline, or a name of the event, I'll put, Total Solar Eclipse".

[Text:]

It happened the 21st of August, 2017. I experienced it in the United States. And for a quick description, I'll put, "Known as the Great American Eclipse, it was the first visible across the whole US since 1918.

Then, click Submit and we see the event we just created. Let's add a memory. [Click.]

[Text:]

My neighbors and I gathered in the courtyard holding colanders as the sky darkened.

Of course, someone using the site for real could write quite a bit more. Click Submit, and we see our newly created memory. And, if we go to the homepage, we see it in the list of Newly Added Memories.

Thanks for checking out I Remember When!
