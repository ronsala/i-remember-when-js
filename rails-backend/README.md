## Installation

You can either clone the repository directly from GitHub into a local directory on your computer or you can Fork the app so that you can contribute to the code.

Once you Fork or Clone this app, cd into that directory and then execute:

*bash:*

```bash
bundle install
rails db:migrate
```

The app uses the [dotenv-rails gem](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for an environment variable for security. Create a file in the top level of the directory, with a .env extension. This file should not be checked into a public repository. In this file, set the values you want to ensure user and admin login secrets, which will be accessible in the ENV hash. For example:

*.env:*

```text
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYHERE
ADMIN_KEY=YOURADMINKEYHERE
```

Then,

*bash:*

```bash
export SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYHERE
export ADMIN_KEY=YOURADMINKEYHERE
```

Please note, the included tests specify the ADMIN_KEY as "149162". Either use this value while testing or change the value in the tests in your fork.

## Usage
